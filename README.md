This study will derive, evaluate, and validate clinically meaningful relationships between clinical concepts using retrospective, de-identified data from an existing OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) database. Tools from the OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) ecosystem will be used to extract co-occurrence patterns and generate concept relationship tables.  Large language models (LLMs) will be applied to the relationships (not to the source data) to characterize the semantic nature of these relationships, with human validation of discordant classifications. No personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) will be accessed.
